## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX Storytelling is important because:
<br>
• It is a way with which we are better able to think from our user's perspectives; to really think about what pain points they might have or what features they might want.
<br>
• It creates a sense of reality. Usually, when designing, it feels like we're designing for an invisible person because we're not actually interacting with real life people. However, with UX storytelling, we're able to put a face and a name, although imaginary, to our work, which makes it more real.
<br>
• It allows the whole team, not just designers, to recenter and get on the same page for what product is being made.
<br>
<br>

## Feature Ideas
From the research I conducted and insights that I collected, I narrowed down on two features that I want to work on designing that I think would help solve the UX problems raised.

1. Homepage article grouping layout
2. Article layouts

## Scenarios and Journey Maps
**Scenario #1: Greg**
<br>
Greg is a 60 year old senior that is retired, so he has a lot of spare time on his hands. He loves to follow the same routine every day, starting with going downstairs to the kitchen and drinking a cup of hot tea while reading the news. Even when he was younger, he used to follow the same routine. However, he used to always read physical newspapers. Now, with newspapers becoming more and more rare, he has switched to using news websites that his children recommended to him. The news sites, however, are difficult for him to navigate. The text is small, the content is cramped, and there are so many functions on the site that he doesn't know where to start. His ultimate goal is to be able to easily use the platform every day to learn about current events without asking his children or grandchildren for technological help. Today, he wants to just explore the top news in the world. 
<br>
Greg opens up CNN.com on his iPad after getting his cup of tea. He is immediately overwhelmed with all the text and images, and is unsure of where to look first. However, after looking closer, he notices the subtitle "Top News". A list of news articles follows closely underneath. Pleased, he clicks on one of the articles and reads through it. After he is done, he presses the back arrow to navigate back to the homepage. When exploring the page, Greg makes sure to look for subtitles to help him understand the groupings of the articles.

**Scenario #2: Lily** 
<br>
Lily is a recent graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles. She majored in Political Science, and wants to find a job related to the field. She reads the news daily so that she is educated on current political events, knowledge that will help her in job interviews and in the job positions themselves. Furthermore, she loves to socialize with people, and finds that understanding current events in the world help with conversation. She wants to explore the news to keep up with trending topics so that she can contribute to conversations with friends.
<br>
Yesterday, Lily's friend mentioned something about the Biden Administration. Interested in learning more, Lily navigates to CNN.com on her laptop. Upon looking at the home page, Lily immediately sees the big title “What Biden got done in his first 100 days”. Underneath are lists of related articles. She clicks on the first one, and is immediately overwhelmed with information. Videos, images, and text are all cluttered together, and she has trouble reading through the article because of all of the wanted and unwanted content. Lily then notices, however, that there are clear section subtitles that help her to understand the purpose of each piece of content and what features she could use. After understanding the page layout more, she is able to read through her article and learn about what Biden has accomplished. She then looks for the “Related Articles” subtitle that she saw earlier and decides which article she wants to read next.
