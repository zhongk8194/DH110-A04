## Purpose of UX Storytelling
ux storytelling is important bc: 
- it is a way with which we are better able to think from our user's perspectives, to really think about what pain points they might have or what features they might want
- it creates a sense of reality. usually, when designing, it fefels like we're designing for an invisible person bc we're not actually interacting w real life people. however, w ux storytelling, we're able to put a face and a name, although imaginary, to our work, which makes our work feel more real
- it allows the whole team, not just designers, to recenter and get on the same page for what product is being made.

2. Article layouts

## Scenarios and Journey Maps
**Scenario #1: Greg**
Greg is a 60 year old senior that is retired, so he has a lot of spare time on his hands. He loves to follow the same routine every day, starting with going downstairs to the kitchen and drinking a cup of hot tea while reading the news. Even when he was younger, he used to follow the same routine. However, he used to always read physical newspapers. Now, with newspapers becoming more and more rare, he has switched to using news websites that his children recommended to him. The news sites, however, are difficult for him to navigate. The text is small, the content is cramped, and there are so many functions on the site that he doesn't know where to start. His ultimate goal is to be able to easily use the platform every day to learn about current events without asking his children or grandchildren for technological help. Today, he wants to just explore thetop news in the world. 

Greg opens up CNN.com on his iPad after getting his cup of tea. He is immediately overwhelmed with all the text and images, and is unsure of where to look first. However, after looking closer, he notices the subtitle "Top News". A list of news articles follows closely underneath. Pleased, he clicks on one of the articles and reads through it. After he is done, he presses the back arrow to navigate back to the homepage. Exploring the page further,
